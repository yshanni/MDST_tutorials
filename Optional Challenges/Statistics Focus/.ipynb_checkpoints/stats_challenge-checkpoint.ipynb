    "**Background**:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are exactly 100 sneaker shops on a sneaker retailing website, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What went wrong with this metric (AOV) and the current analysis in general. Support your answers with appropriate visualizations.\n",
    "  Answer: This metric was likely to be derived from averaging order_values per shop. However, the order value might consist of more than one order, therefore the value is much higher than our intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Propose a new metric that better represents the behavior of the stores' customers. Why are these metrics better and what are their values?\n",
    "  I proposed a new metric called order_value per item. It is calculated be order_value / total_items. This is more representing AOV because it calculates order value per item. The new AOV calculated is 407.99.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the `created_at` column as a proxy for the date and time of order creation, provide a brief analysis of the trends in the customers' purchasing behavior.\n",
    "  Grouping order values by weekday, it looks like the customers make more purchases during weekends.\n",
    "\n",
